My name is Lukas. I am from and live in Germany, 
where I'm about to finish my master studies in the field of computer science at the University of Bremen.

You might have heard of Bremen, because of the famous football club Werder Bremen.

Anyways, I'm interested in programming, computer networks and a lot of other things as well, but that should do for a start.

Do you have any questions? Hit me via mail. Have a great day.
