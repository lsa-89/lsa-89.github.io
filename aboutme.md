#About me 

<div style="text-align: justify">Hello stranger! My name is Lukas. I am from and live in Germany, where I'm about to finish my master studies in the field of computer science at the University of Bremen. I received my B.Sc. in 2017 and will probably succeed with a M.Sc. in the course of 2019.</div>


My professional interests are quite diverse and lie in the following fields:
- Computer networks and information security
- Artificial intelligence and cognition 


You might have heard of Bremen, because of the famous football club Werder Bremen.
Anyways, I'm interested in programming, computer networks and a lot of other things as well, but that should do for a start.
Do you have any questions? Hit me via mail (lukas-samel (at) uni-bremen.de). Have a great day.
