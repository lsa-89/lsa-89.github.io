<div style="text-align: justify">Hello stranger! My name is Lukas. I am from and live in Germany, where I'm about to finish my master studies in the field of computer science at the University of Bremen. I received my B.Sc. in 2017 and will probably succeed with a M.Sc. in the course of 2019.</div>


My professional interests are quite diverse but mostly lie in the fields of:
- Computer networks and information security
- Artificial intelligence and cognition 


<div style="text-align: justify">You might have heard of Bremen, because of the famous football club Werder Bremen. Or because of Beck's beer. Anyways, I spend a lot of time with programming, computer networks and a lot of other things, like bouldering or writing music, as well. I created this tiny page to provide a little bit of personal information about myself and also to provide a selection of the work I have done in the past. If you want to find out more about these projects, you can follow this link.</div> [My projects](projects.md)

<div style="text-align: justify">If you've got any questions or want to get in contact for some other reason, feel free to send me a mail to lukas-samel(at)uni-bremen.de! I think that's about it. Have a great day and keep coding!</div>
