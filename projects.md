<div style="text-align: justify">In Seasons 4 the player gains control of the air elements in order to solve a variety of puzzles, embedded in a lovingly told story of an elderly couple. There are different game mechanics for each season of the year, hence the name Seasons 4. Every season requires the player to first understand the mechanics that come with each season, so that he can then try over and over to find the best possible solution to each puzzle.</div>

## 2015 - Vision Timetable
<div style="text-align: justify">During the software project course at the University of Bremen, five fellow students of mine and I built a tool to create and manage timetables for a primary school located in Bremen. Due to the internal structure of the school, the program needed to handle some minor and major cases, most available timetable tools do not support out of the box, e.g. support for different disjunct time resources. The Vision Timetable is written in Java.</div>
