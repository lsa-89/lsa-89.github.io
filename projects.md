# Some of the projects I worked on in the past

## 2018 - Multithreaded mixed C++ and Prolog node
<div style="text-align: justify">Within the scope of my job at the institute for artificial intelligence Bremen I worked on a service for KnowRob-Queries, that natively runs in a C++ environment, supports multithreading and processes the queries within a prolog engine. This task required detailed studies of the C++/Prolog interface of J. Wielemaker.</div>

## 2018 - Events of Interest in autonomous driving
<div style="text-align: justify">In the context of a course concerning spatial reasoning in computational cognitive systems, two fellow students and I provided proof of concept for detecting dangerous situations by processing an abstraction of the real world scenario (2D pictures) with the declarative programming language prolog and the constraint logic programming framework for qualitative space (CLP(QS)). The program is written in prolog, but the pre processing also involves python.</div>

## 2017 - Seasons 4
<img style="float: right;" src="assets/four.gif">

<div style="text-align: justify">In Seasons 4 the player gains control of the air elements in order to solve a variety of puzzles, embedded in a lovingly told story of an elderly couple. There are different game mechanics for each season of the year, hence the name Seasons 4. Every season requires the player to first understand the mechanics that come with each season, so that he can then try over and over to find the best possible solution to each puzzle.</div>

## 2016 - Glados, the cognitive system
TBA.

## 2015 - Vision Timetable
<div style="text-align: justify">During the software project course at the University of Bremen, five fellow students of mine and I built a tool to create and manage timetables for a primary school located in Bremen. Due to the internal structure of the school, the program needed to handle some minor and major cases, most available timetable tools do not support out of the box, e.g. support for different disjunct time resources. The Vision Timetable is written in Java.</div>
